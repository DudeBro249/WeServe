## Problem

Every year there is an increase in the number of elderly citizens living alone.
These elderly people have special needs that are challenging for them to fulfill.
In some cases these needs arise due to physical and mental conditions or disabilities.

Examples:
1)
Many elderly people need to procure groceries and essentials for the household.
However, it is much more difficult for them to buy such groceries because of physical weakness or, (less commonly) disabilities.
2)
Elderly citizens may also need more medical care and checkups, however are unable to go to hospitals and get them routinely.
In addition, some are unable to go and purchase medicine for themselves.

## Solution: 
WeServe - An app made by me in order to combat these problems. People can sign up as a volunteer in order to help provide for these elderly citizens.
The elderly citizens can then add tasks and requirements as per their needs.
These will be fulfilled by the volunteers in order to help keep the elderly supplied and safe.
